CODE OF CONDUCT
===============

Acknowledgements
================
When contributing to this project or otherwise communicating with team
members through public or private channels you must acknowledge the
contents of the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file.

Conduct
=======
- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender
  identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal
  appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or
  other similar identities.
- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design
  or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There
  is seldom a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term
  “harassment” as including but not limited to:
    - Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against
      another person.
    - Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise
      discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Misgendering.
    - Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting or threatening to post other people's personally
      identifying information ("doxing").
    - Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual
      orientation, race, religion, or disability.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or 
      jokes; and unwelcomed sexual advances.
    - Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in
      person).
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you
  feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a
  community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the
  Rust moderation team immediately. Whether you’re a regular contributor
  or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for
  you and we’ve got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-
  stealing behavior is not welcome.


Moderation
==========
These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of
conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the
maintainer(s).

- Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful,
  hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed.
  (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a
  hateful manner.)
- Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code
  of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
- Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
- If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked
  out of the communication channel to cool off.
- If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be
  banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
- Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was
  a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
- If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please
  take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in
  private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
- Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members.
  If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect
  less leeway than others.

Contributors to this project must strive to go the extra step to look
out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try
to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or
sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often
leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it
can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the
urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about
and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly
accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated
better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow
contributors comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here
first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You
will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as
long as you earn their trust.
